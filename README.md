- Jackie is submitting a ticket under the help topic "Business Critical Outage" regarding an employee who recently returned from a leave of absence. The employee is salaried, but their auto-pay settings are still configured for "on leave," resulting in missed paychecks for the past two pay periods. The employee is understandably upset, and this issue requires escalation. Additionally, Jackie has selected the incorrect help topic for this ticket, and the ticket agent will need to reassign it to the appropriate category.

<p>
Agents will have visibility of active tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will be responsible for prioritizing tickets and assigning them to the appropriate agents, ensuring that the correct SLAs are applied.

This is a view of what an Admin will see when assigning tickets to the appropriate agents. Agents with limited access to payroll or support will only be able to view tickets related to their designated areas. As an Admin, you will have visibility into all incoming tickets.
